## Assumptions

The following software should already be installed on the machine:
  
   - Python interpreter version 2.7 or more
   - The `easy_install` command properly set up

A suggestion would be to setup the enthought canopy python module.

## Install TouchOSC dependencies

There are two applications that need to be installed :

   - The TouchOSC editor (to upload a custom layout onto TouchOSC)
   - The TouchOSC Bridge (to communicate between TouchOSC and any application)

The Touch OSC editor is used to upload the iPhone Composer layout onto the application,
while the TouchOSC Bridge takes care of the midi message mapping.

All required software is provided in the project.

# Install required python modules

Run the script `install_python_modules.sh`.
